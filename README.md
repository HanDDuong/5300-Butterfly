#Milestone 1: Skeleton - SQL shell 

#This milestone will be a program written in C++ that runs from the command line and prompts the user for SQL statements and then executes them one at a time, just like #the mysql program.

#Milestone 2: Rudimentary Storage Engine

#The storage engine is made up of three layers: DbBlock, DbFile, and DbRelation. We'll need abstract base classes for these and also concrete implementations for the #Heap Storage Engine's version of each: SlottedPage, HeapFile, and HeapTable.
