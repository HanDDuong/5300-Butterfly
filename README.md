Milestone 1: Skeleton - SQL shell 

This milestone will be a program written in C++ that runs from the command line and prompts the user for SQL statements and then executes them one at a time, just like the mysql program.

Note: Used Professor Lundeen's version of milestone 1 to assist with the development of milestone 2.
